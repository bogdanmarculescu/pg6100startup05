# PG6100 - Enterprise programming 2

The goal of this repository is to provide an example of a running web application (currently up to exercise Part 05) 
for the Enterprise Programming course. 

The project will be updated in response to questions, as a result of further clarifications, and so on.

This project is only an example, and a small part, of the course.
